# PROJECT TITLE :
Classify the random forest algorithm using skit learn classifier using"RandomForestClassifier" for iris.csv,and predict the data how many species are interconnected with Nth DecisionTree node
# TASK
1. import random forest classifier by using sklearn.ensemble library
2. Load your data using seaborn graphics library as an argument load_iris()
3. Pre-processes the data using skitlearn graphics library
4. Select the model using "model_selection" prompt sns as seaborn and 
   sklearn as a machine learn library
5. Load iris.csv dataset for "data" as a input variable and "target" as a 
   functionable output variable
6. Pick the train and test data using argumental library train_test_split
7. select the estimators as a Nth DecisionTree 
8. Use a RandomForest classifier and fit your model
9. Find out your model accuracy.

# CONCLUSION :
My model has approach 1.00 accuracy , which lies between in the range of 0-1.

Hence it shows that RandomForest Decision Model successfully implemented.
